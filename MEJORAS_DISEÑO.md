# Professional UI/UX Design Improvements

## Purpose

This document summarizes major visual and usability improvements delivered for the web interface layer.

## Implemented Improvements

### 1) Visual Theme Modernization
- Professional dark-theme baseline
- Improved contrast and readability
- Consistent color usage for operational states

### 2) Typography and Hierarchy
- Cleaner heading/body hierarchy
- Better spacing between blocks and controls
- Improved scanability for live diagnostics

### 3) Interaction Quality
- Smoother hover/transition behavior
- Better button/input feedback
- More coherent layout behavior across tabs

### 4) Plot Presentation
- Cleaner plot styling and grid behavior
- Better color consistency across charts
- Improved real-time readability

### 5) Navigation Clarity
- More explicit tab semantics
- Stronger visual distinction for active sections
- Better organization of controls and outputs

## File Impact Summary

- `app.py`: shell layout and styling updates
- `gui/live_capture.py`: visualization and status presentation improvements
- `gui/plot_utils.py`: shared plotting style utilities
- `start_gui.py`: startup compatibility adjustments

## Design Principles Used

- Clarity over ornament
- State-driven visual cues
- Consistency across all tabs
- Fast interpretation in monitoring scenarios

## Next Design Iterations (Optional)

- Theme toggle (dark/light)
- Accessibility pass (WCAG contrast + keyboard focus refinement)
- Export-ready reporting views
- Compact mode for dense diagnostic sessions
